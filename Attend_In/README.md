# Attend_In
Attend_In is an Android app that uses geolocation from IP address for T&amp;A in classroom.

The app retrieves the student's IP address and uses it to get location coordinates.  
It then compares the student's location with the classroom's location to see if the student is within the range of the classroom. 
The student is then able to Check In to the class by entering their student ID to easily do attendance.  
If the student is found to be out of the range of the classroom, the student is not able to Check In.
